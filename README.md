# Semantic Search Engine – EPL 2023–24

This project explores semantic search over full-match commentary from the English Premier League 2023–24 season using NLP techniques.

The goal is to retrieve relevant matches based on natural language queries, focusing on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.
